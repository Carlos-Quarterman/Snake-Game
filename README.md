# Snake and Apple Game in Pygame

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake and Apple game using Pygame and Python.

## Game Description

In the Snake and Apple game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. However, if the snake collides with itself, the game ends.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- Guide the snake to eat the apples that appear on the screen.
- Avoid letting the snake collide with itself.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
